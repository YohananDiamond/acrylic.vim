# acrylic.nvim

A little notes format I made for myself, modeled mostly after Markdown,
Org, and LaTeX.

Currently compatible with vim (I think?), but I might move this into
neovim-only in the future.

## Why "acrylic"?

I was thinking of a name and the word came to mind. It works as an
analogy where this format is acrylic and others - such as Markdown, Org
and LaTeX - are glass.

Glass is usually a more robust material, but it's usually more expensive
and heavier. Acrylic is less resistant to scratches, UV and germs, but
it's light and cheap.

It's a really bad analogy. But the name's nice. Sorry.
