# acrylic.nvim

A little notetaking/task format I made for myself, modeled mostly after
Markdown, Org, and LaTeX.

Currently compatible with vim (I think?), but I might move this into
neovim-only in the future.

## Example

See [doc/acrylic-example.acr](doc/acrylic-example.acr)

## Why "acrylic"?

I was thinking of a name and the word came to mind. It works as an
analogy where this format is acrylic and others - such as Markdown, Org
and LaTeX - are glass.

Glass is usually more robust, but it can also be heavier and more
expensive. In contrast, Acrylic is less resistant to scratches, UV rays
and germs, but it's light and cheap.

It's a really bad analogy. But the name's nice. Sorry.
